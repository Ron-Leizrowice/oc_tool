# OC Tool (pending a better name)

## What does this do?

Allows you to apply an assortment of experimental Windows tweaks, and undo them. 

They might improve performance, or make things worse, depending on the benchmark you are running.

### How to use

Run the .exe as administrator. Any tweaks you already have enabled should be detected by default. Click to apply any new ones.

### Development

This is a work in progress. If you encounter bugs, or want to suggest new tweaks, please open an issue, or DM me on Discord (Ron Leizrowice)
