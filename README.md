# OC Tool (pending a better name)

## What does this tool do?

- Allows you to apply an assortment of experimental Windows tweaks, and undo them. 
- They might improve performance, or make things worse, depending on your OS, hardware, and the benchmark you are running.

## What is supported?

- Currently only Windows 11 is fully supported.
- Windows 10 support is experimental.

### How to use

Run the .exe as administrator. Any tweaks you already have enabled should be detected by default. Click to apply any new ones.

### Development

This is a work in progress. If you encounter bugs, or want to suggest new tweaks, please open an issue, or DM me on Discord (Ron Leizrowice)
